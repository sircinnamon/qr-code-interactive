# QR Code Generator/Editor/Debugger

Basically I wanted to learn what goes into QR codes (turns out it's mostly math)

## TODO
- Properly evaluate which masks to use
- Support alternate modes (bytes/numbers/kanji)
- Support versions 2-40
- Determine version + EC level dynamically, if not provided
- Support MiniQR
- Support all EC levels
- Fix ReedSolomon handling of undefined
- Render to SVG
