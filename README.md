# QR Code Generator/Editor/Debugger

Basically I wanted to learn what goes into QR codes (turns out it's mostly math).

This code was not designed to be "efficient" - it stores redundant data at multiple stages. It was designed to be able to docnstruct the QR code at any stage of it's rendering and see what all the moving parts are.
